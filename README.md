# GOLLMF

A word game that challenges players to get the correct answer using as few words or tokens as possible with GPT.

## Game Concept

GOLLMF (pronounced "Golf") is a word game where the objective is to communicate with an AI (GPT) to reach a target answer or solution using the minimum number of words or tokens possible. Think of it like golf - the lower your score (fewer words), the better!
